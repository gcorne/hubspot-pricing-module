![Pricing card screenshot]('./screenshots/1-pricing-card.png)

The **Pricing card module** is a simple module for the HubSpot CMS that demonstrates how using a repeater and other features of the module system can be used to create a simple editing experience. The module is part of the [HubSpot CMS Theme Boilerplate](https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate), so the best way to see the module in action together with other modules is to play around with the boilerplate.

## Getting started

To try out the module in HubSpot, you can leverage the [@hubspot/cms-cli](https://designers.hubspot.com/docs/tools/local-development) to upload the module to HubSpot.

1. Run `npm install`

1. Run `npx hscms upload "Pricing card.module" "Pricing card.module"`. This will upload the module to the HubSpot Design Manager.
